# aws-lambda-runtime-pypy
Custom Runtime for AWS Lambda using the Pypy interpreter. This was inspired by
the [AWS Tutorial for creating a Custom Runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-walkthrough.html)

Run
```bash
sls deploy
```
for deploying this example Lambda based on a Pypy runtime to AWS.
